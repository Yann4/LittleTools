# LittleTools
Some little tools that I might find handy at some point.

Currently available:

Infix to reverse polish notation converter:
    Could use some cleaning up and extending, but it works.
    To build, run "make reverse_polish"

Bitstring class:
    Needs some more operators (stream operators)
    Could probably do with some extra functionality too
    To build, run "make bitstring" (although I somehow doubt it'll work - no main())

Quack:
    Dumbass data structure, but it was fun to make, so I don't really want to lose it to the ether.
    Amalgamation of Stack and Queue. Ordered list that returns a tuple of the front and back elements
