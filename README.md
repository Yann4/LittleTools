# LittleTools
Some little tools that I might find handy at some point.

Currently available:

Infix to reverse polish notation converter:
    Could use some cleaning up and extending, but it works.
    To build, run "make reverse_polish"

Bitstring class:
    Needs some more operators (stream operators)
    Could probably do with some extra functionality too
    To build, run "make bitstring" (although I somehow doubt it'll work - no main())
